# What is STNET ID? And How to Access It

It is a Single Sign-On (SSO) system for accessing various services conveniently under one login. We call this system "STNET ID." Read the additional announcement [here](/stnetid/movetostnetid.md).

## What is STNET ID?

STNET ID is a system that employees and affiliates can use to update personal information and access related services. The purpose of this system is to facilitate and enhance the security of login procedures. You can log in at [id.stnetradio.co](https://id.stnetradio.co) (for stnetradio.co domain or STNET Radio employees only, it is not available yet; please wait for further announcements).

## How to Access for Employees

Steps to access email for the first time for employees who just started using STNET ID.

### First-time Login (For Employees Who Received Accounts After October 15, 2024)

## Troubleshooting

### If the Passkey Registration Page Does Not Appear After Password Creation

If the passkey registration page does not appear but the password change is successful, follow these steps:

1. Return to the Google Account login page.
2. Enter your email and click "Next."
3. Enter your email or username.
4. Enter the newly created password and click "Continue."
5. You will be able to create a new passkey. Please proceed by confirming on another device (if using an office device).

   - If you choose not to create a passkey, you can still use the account, but when logging in again, you will not be able to use Face ID, Touch ID, or any physical identifiers to log in. You will need to enter a password to log in.
   - If you are unable to log in due to incorrect email, username, or password, please ensure the information is correct. If the email or username is correct, select "Forgot Password" and follow the steps again.

Once the passkey registration is complete, you will be redirected to Google's page. If not, check the solution [here](#undefined-6).

2. Enter the employee's email and click "Next."
3. When you reach 'auth.stnetradio.co', proceed with the passkey.
