# What is STNET ID? And how to use it

STNET ID is a Single Sign-On (SSO) system for logging into various services of the company. This system is called "STNET ID." Read more announcements [here](/stnetid/movetostnetid.md).

## What is STNET ID?

STNET ID is a system that employees and associates can use to update personal information and access work-related services. The purpose of this system is to provide convenience and enhance security when logging in. You can access the system at [id.stnetradio.co](https://id.stnetradio.co) (only for the stnetradio.co domain or STNET Radio employees, not yet available; please wait for further announcements).

## Troubleshooting

Simple troubleshooting methods from us. You can read more [here]. If you're unable to solve the issue, please contact us at [team@stnetradio.co](mailto:team@stnetradio.co).

<details>

<summary>If the Passkey registration page does not appear but shows the password change success page</summary>

If you have created a password but do not see the Passkey registration page, follow these steps:

### 1. Return to the Google Account login page

You need to return to the main Google Account page to log in again.

### 2. Log in again

You need to log in again using your @stnetradio.co or @team.stnetradio.co email address to log in using STNET ID.

### 3. Log in to STNET ID

The system will then redirect you to STNET ID. Enter your email and the newly created password, then click "continue." The system will take you to the Passkey creation page.

### 4. Create a Passkey

You will be able to create a new Passkey. Choose to create a Passkey and continue by verifying on another device (if using office equipment).

  - If you choose not to create a Passkey, you can still use your account. However, when logging in again, you will not be able to use Face ID, Touch ID, or physical authentication for login. You will need to enter your password instead.
  - If unable to log in due to incorrect email, username, or password, please check to ensure correctness. If the email or username is correct, select "Forgot password" and follow the steps again.

After successful Passkey registration, the system will take you to Google's page. If not, read the solution [here](#if-passkey-registration-returns-to-the-registration-page-again-what-should-you-do).
