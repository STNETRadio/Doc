# Announcement on Logging in with STNET ID

The STNET Radio team would like to inform you that we have implemented a Single Sign-On (SSO) system to streamline access to the company’s services, which we call "STNET ID."

## What is STNET ID?

STNET ID is a system that allows employees and relevant personnel to edit personal information and access various services related to work. The system aims to increase convenience and security when logging in. You can log in at [id.stnetradio.co](https://id.stnetradio.co) (for the stnetradio.co domain or STNET Radio employees only; the system is not yet available, please wait for further announcements).

## Services that Require a New Password

If you wish to access the following services, you will need to create a new password:

- Google Workspace
- Microsoft 365
- STNET Radio Plus for Creators
- STNET Radio Podcaster

## Services that Do Not Require a New Password

The following services do not require a new password and do not use the STNET ID system:

- GoDaddy Web Email
- GitHub
- Slack
- And others

### How to create a new password for the first login 

For services that require STNET ID, you can create a new password following these steps:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Login

Log in to Google Accounts using your company email address (the system will log you out immediately after the first use). After entering your email, click "Next." The system will take you to `auth.stnetradio.co` —don’t worry, just follow the next steps.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Change Password

Once you access STNET ID, enter your email or username, then click "continue." Next, select “Forgot password” and follow the instructions to create a new password.

Enter the 6-digit confirmation code sent to your email, then create and confirm your new password.

After registration, you'll be redirected to the Passkey registration page. Follow the instructions to register by selecting to verify on another device (if using office equipment). Once successful, the system will take you to Google's page. If not, read the solution [here](#if-the-passkey-registration-page-does-not-appear-but-shows-the-password-change-success-page).

## Troubleshooting

Simple troubleshooting methods from us. You can read more [here]. If you're unable to solve the issue, please contact us at [team@stnetradio.co](mailto:team@stnetradio.co).

<details>

<summary>If the Passkey registration page does not appear but shows the password change success page</summary>

If you have created a password but do not see the Passkey registration page, follow these steps:

### 1. Return to the Google Account login page

You need to return to the main Google Account page to log in again.

### 2. Log in again

You need to log in again using your @stnetradio.co or @team.stnetradio.co email address to log in using STNET ID.

### 3. Log in to STNET ID

The system will then redirect you to STNET ID. Enter your email and the newly created password, then click "continue." The system will take you to the Passkey creation page.

### 4. Create a Passkey

You will be able to create a new Passkey. Choose to create a Passkey and continue by verifying on another device (if using office equipment).

  - If you choose not to create a Passkey, you can still use your account. However, when logging in again, you will not be able to use Face ID, Touch ID, or physical authentication for login. You will need to enter your password instead.
  - If unable to log in due to incorrect email, username, or password, please check to ensure correctness. If the email or username is correct, select "Forgot password" and follow the steps again.

After successful Passkey registration, the system will take you to Google's page. If not, read the solution [here](#if-passkey-registration-returns-to-the-registration-page-again-what-should-you-do).
