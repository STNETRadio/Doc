# Announcement on Logging in with STNET ID

The STNET Radio team would like to inform you that we have implemented a Single Sign-On (SSO) system to streamline access to the company’s services, which we call "STNET ID."

## What is STNET ID?

STNET ID is a system that allows employees and relevant personnel to edit personal information and access various services related to work. The system aims to increase convenience and security when logging in. You can log in at [id.stnetradio.co](https://id.stnetradio.co) (for the stnetradio.co domain or STNET Radio employees only; the system is not yet available, please wait for further announcements).

## Services that Require a New Password

If you wish to access the following services, you will need to create a new password:

- Google Workspace
- Microsoft 365
- STNET Radio Plus for Creators
- STNET Radio Podcaster

## Services that Do Not Require a New Password

The following services do not require a new password and do not use the STNET ID system:

- GoDaddy Web Email
- GitHub
- Slack
- And others

## How to Create a New Password

For services that require STNET ID, you can create a new password by following these steps:

1. Log into Google Accounts using your company email address (the system will automatically log you out after your first use).
2. After entering your email, select “Next.”
3. The system will take you to 'auth.stnetradio.co.' Don’t worry, continue with the following steps.
4. Enter your email or username and proceed.
5. Select “Forgot password” and follow the instructions to create a new password.
6. Enter the 6-digit verification code sent to your email.
7. Create and confirm your new password.

After registering successfully, you will be redirected to the passkey registration page. Follow the instructions to register by confirming on another device (if using office equipment). Once completed, the system will take you to the Google page. If not, refer to the troubleshooting guide [here](#undefined-6).

## Troubleshooting

### If the Passkey Registration Page Does Not Appear but Shows a Password Change Confirmation

If you create a new password and the passkey registration page does not appear but instead shows a password change confirmation, please follow these steps:

1. Go back to the Google Account login page.
2. Enter your email and select “Next.”
3. Enter your email or username.
4. Enter the new password you created and proceed.
5. You will be able to create a new passkey. Proceed with passkey creation by confirming on another device (if using office equipment).

If you choose not to create a passkey, you can still use your account, but for future logins, you will not be able to use Face ID, Touch ID, or biometric data for logging in. You will need to enter your password to access the system.

If you cannot log in because the email, username, or password is incorrect, please double-check for accuracy. If your email or username is correct, select “Forgot password” and follow the steps again.

Once passkey registration is successful, the system will take you to the Google page. If not, refer to the troubleshooting guide [here](#undefined-6).

### What to Do If Your Email or Username Is Not Found

If you encounter this issue, you must contact us immediately for data correction. Contact us at [team@stnetradio.co](mailto:team@stnetradio.co).

### What to Do If You Are Redirected to the Passkey Registration Page Again After Registering

If you face this issue, you can fix it as follows:
1. Close the passkey registration page and reopen the login page (go to Google.com and select “Sign in”).
2. Enter your employee email and select “Next.”
3. When you reach the 'auth.stnetradio.co' page, proceed with passkey authentication.
4. If the option to proceed with a passkey does not appear, select the option to log in with an email or username. Your device will then show the passkey login option.
5. If your device does not show the option to log in with a passkey, you can check supported devices [here](/stnetid/passkeysupported.md).

If you encounter registration issues or have any further questions, please contact us at: [team@stnetradio.co](mailto:team@stnetradio.co).
